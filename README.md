# Golang POCs

This repository contains a collection of **proof-of-concept (POC)** examples designed for testing and experimenting with various **Go (Golang)** concepts. The goal is to demonstrate different features and best practices in Go through small, isolated examples.

## Contents

Each folder or file within this repository contains a specific concept or feature implemented in Go. These POCs cover a wide range of Go topics, such as:

- Interfaces and Structs
- Goroutines and Concurrency
- Error Handling and Logging
- Go Modules and Dependency Management
- Testing and Benchmarking
- Networking and HTTP
- And much more...

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the POCs, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimRutte/golang-pocs.git
```

### 2. Navigate to a Specific POC
Each folder or file within the repository represents a different POC. You can navigate to the respective folder and run the Go code.

For example, to explore the POC for interfaces:

```bash
cd interfaces
go run main.go
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (if needed)
Some examples may have additional dependencies. To install them, simply run:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 4. Explore and Modify
Feel free to experiment with the code! Modify the examples to test different variations and gain a deeper understanding of the Go concepts.
